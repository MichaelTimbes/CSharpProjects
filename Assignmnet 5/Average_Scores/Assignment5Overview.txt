Main Goal: Using C#, write a program to calculate the average of all scores entered between 0 and 100.
Specifications:

	1)Use asentinel-controlled loop variable to terminate the loop. The program will then ask if the user wants to enter another set of scores, 
	and repeat the same process if the user entersa letter y (or Y), or quit if the user enters any other character. 
		A)Loop type will be a while loop with sentinel "chr" of type char. 
		B)The exit condition will be (while chr!= 'Y'| !(input < 0)). A to upper will be used to make sure
		the character input is a capitalized. Possibly a nested while loop to allow for continuation
	2)After values are entered and the average calculated, test the average to determine whether an A, B, C, D, or F should be recorded. Grading 
	scale A: 90-100; B: 80 - 89; C: 70 - 79; D: 60-69; F: < 60.
		A)Seperate function 'double calc_avg(double [] array)' to have access to the data within array.
			a) The function will return local variable 'average' of type double.
		B)Seperate function 'char grade(double average)' returns the grade character that reflects the average.
			b) following if statement structure will be used   
			if (average<=100 | average >= 90){return A;} 
				else if (average<=89 | average >= 80){return B;} 
				else if (average<=79 | average >= 70){return C;}
				else if (average<=69 | average >= 60){return D;}
			else{return F;}
	3)Output in this format:
	"The average of the {0} ",scores.size();," scores entered is {0}" average; 
	"The assigned letter grade is {0}", grade;

char input;
double score;
char grade;
int arr_size;
